Conversation memory enables agents to maintain context across multiple interactions. Agents remember previous messages and use them to provide coherent, context-aware responses in multi-turn conversations.

## Enabling conversation memory

Set `conversation_history` to specify how many previous messages to retain:

```python
from polos import Agent

conversational_agent = Agent(
    id="chat-agent",
    provider="openai",
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant. Be friendly and concise.",
    conversation_history=10  # Keep last 10 messages (i.e. 5 conversation turns)
)
```

The agent automatically manages conversation history - no manual bookkeeping required.
**Defaults to conversation_history=10** when you don't specify anything.

## Using conversation IDs

Group related messages using `conversation_id`.

Works with `agent.run()`:

```python
result = await research_agent.run(
    user_message,
    conversation_id=conversation_id
)
```

and `agent.stream()`:
```python
stream = await research_agent.stream(
    user_message,
    conversation_id=conversation_id
)
```


**How it works:**

1. Agent retrieves past messages for this `conversation_id`
2. Includes them in the LLM context
3. Stores the new message after generating a response

## Example

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    conversation_id = "user-123-session-1"
    
    # Turn 1
    response1 = await my_agent.run(
        "My name is Alice and I love Python.",
        conversation_id=conversation_id
    )
    print(response1.result)
    
    # Turn 2 - Agent remembers Alice and Python
    response2 = await my_agent.run(
        "What's my favorite programming language?",
        conversation_id=conversation_id
    )
    print(response2.result)  # "Your favorite programming language is Python"
    
    # Turn 3 - Agent remembers the name
    response3 = await my_agent.run(
        "What's my name?",
        conversation_id=conversation_id
    )
    print(response3.result)  # "Your name is Alice"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## History limits

The `conversation_history` parameter controls the maximum number of messages retained:

```python
# Keep last 20 messages
agent = Agent(
    id="agent",
    conversation_history=20
)
```

**What happens when the limit is exceeded:**

- Oldest messages are dropped
- Most recent messages (in this example, 20 messages) are kept
- Agent always has the latest context
