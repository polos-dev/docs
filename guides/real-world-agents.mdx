Full agent implementations that go beyond cookbook recipes. Each example is a complete project you can clone, configure, and run.

All examples are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/polos-dev/polos-examples).

## Coding agent for GitHub issues

A multi-agent system that automatically analyzes GitHub issues and generates code fixes. Two specialized agents - a **planner** and a **coder** - share a Docker sandbox where they can read files, write code, run commands, and execute tests.

**What it does:**

1. Receives a GitHub issue (via CLI or webhook)
2. **Planner agent** explores the codebase using sandbox tools (`exec`, `read`, `glob`, `grep`) and produces a fix plan
3. **Coder agent** implements the fix using `write` and `edit`, then commits and pushes inside the Docker container
4. Workflow **suspends for human approval** - shows the diff, commit log, and files changed
5. On approval, creates a pull request and comments on the original issue

**Polos features used:**

- **[Sandboxed execution](/agents/sandbox)** - Both agents share a session-scoped Docker container with git credentials, network access, and built-in tools
- **[Human-in-the-loop](/agents/human-in-the-loop)** - Form-based approval with diff preview, rejection with feedback, 24-hour timeout
- **[Durable workflows](/fundamentals/durable-execution)** - 10 checkpointed steps. If the process crashes after the coder finishes, it resumes from the approval step - no agents re-run, no LLM calls repeated
- **[Triggers](/workflows/event-triggered-workflows)** - Can be triggered automatically via `github/issues/opened` events

**Run it:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polos-dev/polos-examples.git
cd polos-examples/github-issue-fixer
```

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
cd python
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and GITHUB_TOKEN
polos dev
```

```bash TypeScript
cd typescript
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and GITHUB_TOKEN
polos dev
```

</CodeGroup>

Then trigger it on an issue:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
python main.py owner/repo#123
```

```bash TypeScript
npx tsx main.ts owner/repo#123
```

</CodeGroup>
