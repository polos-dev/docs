Polos is a **durable execution platform** for AI agents. It ensures your agent workflows survive failures, scale automatically, and maintain state across long-running operations.

# Architecture

Polos has two main components:

**Orchestrator** – Manages workflow execution, handles scheduling, concurrency control, queueing, and automatic retries. The orchestrator tracks workflow state and pushes execution requests to available workers.

**Workers** – Execute your workflow code. Each worker runs a FastAPI server that receives execution requests from the orchestrator, runs your Python code logic, and reports results back.

# How it works

**1. Workflow invocation**  
When an agent/workflow is started, the orchestrator receives the request and queues it for execution.

**2. Execution**  
The orchestrator pushes the workflow execution to an available worker via HTTP. The worker executes your code step-by-step, persisting state after each step.

**3. Concurrency control**  
If too many workflow instances are running, the orchestrator queues new runs until execution slots open up. You can configure concurrency limits per queue.

**4. Failure handling**  
If a worker crashes or a step fails, the orchestrator automatically retries the workflow. It resumes from the last completed step - no lost progress.

**5. Workflow composition**  
When a workflow invokes child workflows, the orchestrator suspends the parent (preserving its state) and executes children. Once children complete, the parent resumes with their results.
