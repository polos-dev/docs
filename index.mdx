# Introduction

**Building agents is easy. Running them in production is hard.**

Polos handles sandboxes, durability, approvals, triggers, and observability — so you can focus on writing the agent.
No DAGs. No graph syntax. Just Python or TypeScript.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from polos import Agent, sandbox_tools, SandboxToolsConfig, DockerConfig

# Create a sandboxed environment — agents get exec, read, write,
# edit, glob, and grep tools automatically.
sandbox = sandbox_tools(SandboxToolsConfig(
    env="docker",
    docker=DockerConfig(image="node:20-slim", memory="2g"),
))

# Give the agent sandbox tools — it can now run commands,
# read/write files, and explore the codebase autonomously.
coding_agent = Agent(
    id="coding_agent",
    provider="anthropic",
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    system_prompt="You are a coding assistant. The repo is at /workspace.",
    tools=sandbox,  # exec, read, write, edit, glob, grep
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { defineAgent, sandboxTools } from '@polos/sdk';
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';

// Create a sandboxed environment — agents get exec, read, write,
// edit, glob, and grep tools automatically.
const sandbox = sandboxTools({
  env: 'docker',
  docker: {
    image: 'node:20-slim',
    memory: '2g',
  },
});

// Give the agent sandbox tools — it can now run commands,
// read/write files, and explore the codebase autonomously.
const codingAgent = defineAgent({
  id: 'coding_agent',
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5'),
  systemPrompt: 'You are a coding assistant. The repo is at /workspace.',
  tools: [...sandbox], // exec, read, write, edit, glob, grep
});
```

## Polos vs. Typical Agent Frameworks

| Challenge | Typical agent framework | With Polos |
|-----------|------------------------|------------|
| **Sandboxing** | None - DIY or run unsandboxed | Docker, E2B + built-in tools (exec, files, search) |
| **Durability** | Agent crashes, start over | Auto-retry, resume from exact step |
| **Approvals** | Build it yourself | Slack, UI, terminal - one tap |
| **Triggers** | Glue code for every webhook | Built-in: HTTP, webhooks, cron, events |
| **Observability** | Grep through logs | Full tracing, every tool call, every decision |
| **Cost** | Re-run failed LLM calls from scratch | Durable execution, prompt caching, 60-80% savings |

## What You Get With Polos

- **[Sandboxed Execution](/agents/sandbox)** — Isolated Docker and E2B environments. Built-in tools: exec, read, write, edit, glob, grep, web_search. No tool code to write, no sandbox lifecycle to manage.
- **[Human-in-the-Loop](/agents/human-in-the-loop)** — Approval flows for any tool call. Reach your team via Slack, Discord, email. Paused agents consume zero compute.
- **[Durable Workflows](/fundamentals/durable-execution)** — Auto-retry, log-replay, concurrency control. Resume from the exact step that failed. 60-80% cost savings via prompt caching.
- **[Triggers](/workflows/event-triggered-workflows)** — Webhook URLs, HTTP API, cron schedules, event-driven. Slack integration with no glue code.
- **[Observability](/observability/tracing)** — OpenTelemetry tracing for every step, tool call, and approval. Full execution history. Visual dashboard for monitoring and debugging.
- **Bring Your Stack** — Any LLM via Vercel AI SDK and LiteLLM. CrewAI, LangGraph, and Mastra compatible. Python or TypeScript. Open source - run anywhere.

### CLI and UI to monitor and run your agents

```bash
polos dev                    # Start server + worker with hot reload
polos run <agent>            # Start an interactive session with an agent
polos agent list             # List available agents
polos tool list              # List available tools
polos logs <agent>           # Stream logs from agent runs
```

## What Can You Build?

- **[Coding Agent](/guides/18-sandbox-tools)** — Clones repos, writes code, runs tests, and opens PRs — all inside a Docker sandbox with human approval before anything ships.
- **[Data Analyst](/guides/22-approval-page)** — Connects to data warehouses, executes SQL in sandboxed environments, builds charts, sends approval pages before sharing with stakeholders.
- **[Research Agent](/guides/20-web-search-agent)** — Crawls multiple sources, extracts findings, builds knowledge bases. Durable execution checkpoints after each source. Notifies via Slack or Discord.
- **[Order Processing](/guides/17-order-processing)** — Handles incoming orders, runs fraud checks, suspends for human review on flagged transactions. Exactly-once execution guarantees no double charges.
- **[Scheduled Workflows](/guides/16-scheduled-workflows)** — Cron-triggered agents that run nightly data syncs, generate reports, or clean up stale resources. Durable state means missed runs pick up where they left off.
