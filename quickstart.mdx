## Get started with Polos

Build your first durable agent in three simple steps.

### Step 1: Start the Polos orchestrator

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Install Polos">
    Install the Polos CLI and start the orchestrator:
    
    ```bash
    pip install polos
    polos start
    ```
    
    <Tip>The orchestrator manages workflow execution and state persistence.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Write your first agent

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Create an agent">
    Create a simple agent that performs a task:
    
    ```python
    from polos import Agent
    
    agent = Agent(
        name="my-first-agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant"
    )
    
    result = agent.run("What is the weather today?")
    ```
    
    <Tip>Agents automatically handle retries and state persistence.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Start a worker

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Run a worker">
    Start a worker to execute your agent:
    
    ```bash
    polos worker start
    ```
    
    Your agent will now execute with full durability guarantees.
  </Accordion>
